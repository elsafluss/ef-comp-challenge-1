# Static Comp Recreation 

For this assignment, we were asked to recreate the layout of a static image of a web page, using our own creativity and discretion when it came to everything other than item placement. The final page had to be responsive over multiple breakpoints, useful, and intuitive. [Here are the instructions we were given.](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp)

The original comp:
